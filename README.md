# Learn & Teach better.

Okuta is a schooling platform for learning.

### Mocking

Want to see a preview of the site? Well, its eady! First, make sure you have `nodejs` installed on your system!

Then create a folder somewhere, and open a terminal / command line in it! From there you can type the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/sqwwy/okuta.git
```

Now, you need to install the packages `express` and `nodemon` in your directory with this command:

```
npm i express nodemon
```

Now, all you have to do is run this command:

```
npm run start
```

Now you are able to go to the website `localhost:3000` and see the website for yourself! If you have any issues in the command line make sure you don't already have a site hosted on port 3000, or make sure that you installed all of the required packages and actually cloned the repository.
